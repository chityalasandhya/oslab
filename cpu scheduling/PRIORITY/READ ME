Priority Scheduling:
 Assume a priority is associated with each process.
 Assume all processes arrive at the same time.
 Select highest priority process from the ready queue.
 SJF is a special case of priority scheduling.
 Equal-priority processes are scheduled in FCFS order.
 Priorities can be defined internally
 Memory requirements, number of open files, burst times
 Priorities can be defined externally
 Preemptive or Non-preemptive

Implementation:
	
	1.First input the processes with their burst time and priority.
	2.Sort the processes,burst time and priority according to the priority.
	3.Now, apply FCFS on the processes.
	4.Calculate average waiting time and turn around time.
