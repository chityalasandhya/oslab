Short job first:
 Solution to the Convoy Effect problem.
 Assume the next burst time of each process is known
 SJF selects process which has the shortest burst time
 Optimal algorithm because it has the shortest average waiting time
 Equal burst time processes are scheduled in FCFS order
 Impossible to know in advance
 OS knows the past burst times- make a prediction using an average
 Non-preemptive Or preemptive

Implementation : 
	
	1.Input the processes along with their burst time.
	2.Sort the processes according to their burst time.
	3.Find waiting time for all processes as Waiting time (Wt) = TAT - BT
	4.Find turn around time for all processes as Turan Around Time (tat) = wt + Bt
	5.Calculate average waiting time and average turn around time.
