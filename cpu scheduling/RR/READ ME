Round Robin:
 Similar to FCFS, but preemption to switch between processes
 Time quantum(time slice) is a small unit of time (10 to 100 ms)
 Process is executed on the CPU for at most one-time quantum
 Implemented by using the ready queue as a circular queue
 Head process gets the CPU
 Uses less than a time quantum implies gives up the CPU voluntary
 Uses full time quantum implies timer will cause an interrupt
 Context switch will be executed
 Process will be put at the tail of queue
 Preemptive


	Implementation:
	
	1.Create an array temp[] to keep track of remaining burst time of processes.
	2.Create another array wt[] to store waiting times of processes.Initialize this array as 0.
	3.Initialize time t=0.
	4.Keep traversing all the processes while all processes are not done.Do following (i)th process if it is not done yet.
	      a-If temp[i]>quantum
	          t=t+quantum
	          temp[i]-=quantum
	      b-Else
	          t=t+temp[i]
	          wt[i]=t-bt[i]
	          t[i]=0
	5.Once we calculate waiting times,we can compute tat[i] as wt[i]+bt[i].
	6.calculate average waiting and turn around time of given processes.
