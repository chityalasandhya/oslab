First come first serve
 First-come, First served is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
 Ready queue is a FIFO queue.
 Longest waiting process at the front of queue.
 New ready processes join the rear.
 Non-preemptive: executes until voluntarily gives up CPU finished or waits for some event.
 Convoy Effect Problem: CPU bound process may execute a long CPU burst processes, so the
processes with very short CPU bursts, wait in queue Reduces CPU and I/O device utilization.

Implementation:
1.Input the processes along with their burst time.
2.Find waiting time for all processes.
3.As first process that comes need not to wait,so wt[0]=0.
4.Find wt for all remaining processes i.e., wt[i] = bt[i-1] + wt[i-1].
5.Find tat = wt + bt for all processes.
6.Find average wt = total_wt / number of processes.
7.Find average tat = total_tat / number of processes.
